## Objective

The objective of TicTacToe is to be the first player to align three of your marks (**X** or **O**) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a 3x3 grid.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Game:**
   - Ensure you are logged into RetroPlayHub.
   - Navigate to the TicTacToe game interface at `http://localhost/RetroPlayHub/components/tic-tac-toe/index.html`.

2. **Select Difficulty:**
   - Choose a difficulty level from the dropdown menu:
     - **Easy:** AI makes random moves.
     - **Medium:** AI blocks your potential winning moves.
     - **Hard:** AI uses advanced strategies (Minimax algorithm) for optimal play.

3. **Start the Game:**
   - Click the **"Start Game"** button to initialize a new match.
   - The status message will display **"Player X's turn"**, indicating it's your move.

## Game Controls

- **Making a Move:**
  - Click on any empty cell within the 3x3 grid to place your mark (**X**).
  - After your move, the AI will automatically make its move based on the selected difficulty.

- **Resetting the Game:**
  - At any point, click the **"Reset Game"** button to clear the board and start a new match.
  - Resetting will also allow you to select a different difficulty level if desired.

## Game Rules

1. **Turns:**
   - **Player X** always makes the first move.
   - Players alternate turns, placing their respective marks on the grid.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - Align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The first player to achieve this wins the game.

3. **Draw Condition:**
   - If all nine cells are filled without any player achieving a winning alignment, the game ends in a draw.

## Strategies for Success

- **Center Control:**
  - Taking the center cell gives you the most opportunities to create winning combinations.

- **Corner Occupation:**
  - Occupying corners increases the chances of forming multiple winning paths.

- **Blocking:**
