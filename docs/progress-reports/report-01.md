# Progress Report - RetroPlay Hub

**Report Number:** 03  
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Completed By:** [Your Name]

## **1. Overview**

In **Step 3: Frontend Development**, the primary focus was on designing and implementing the **Landing Page**. This included creating the main navigation, integrating Bootstrap for responsiveness, and setting up placeholder pages for each game. Additionally, the Login and Registration functionalities were established to handle user authentication.

## **2. Tasks Completed**

### **3.1. Landing Page**

- **Design and Layout:**
  - Created a responsive Landing Page (`index.html`) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
  - Implemented a navbar with links to Login and Registration pages.
  - Added buttons for navigating to each game: TicTacToe, Connect the Dots, and Hangman.
  - Customized styles in `assets/css/styles.css` to enhance visual appeal and accessibility.

- **Placeholder Game Pages:**
  - Developed simple `index.html` files for each game component to ensure navigation works correctly.
  - Each game page includes a navbar and a back-to-home button.

### **3.2. Authentication Pages**

- **Login Page (`login.php`):**
  - Designed a user-friendly login form.
  - Implemented session handling to display error messages.
  - Created backend processing script (`process_login.php`) to authenticate users.

- **Registration Page (`register.php`):**
  - Developed a registration form for new users.
  - Implemented session handling to display success and error messages.
  - Created backend processing script (`process_register.php`) to handle user account creation.

### **3.3. Backend Integration**

- **User Authentication:**
  - Established secure user registration and login functionalities.
  - Utilized PHP's `password_hash` and `password_verify` for secure password management.
  - Ensured database interactions are secure and sanitized to prevent SQL injection.

### **3.4. Documentation**

- **Developer Guide:**
  - Updated `architecture.md` with details on frontend structure and authentication endpoints.
  - Documented the setup process and frontend components.
  
- **User Guide:**
  - Created a comprehensive `README.md` in `docs/user-guide/README.md` to guide users through registration, login, and game navigation.

- **API Documentation:**
  - Outlined potential API endpoints in `docs/developer-guide/api-documentation.md` for future reference as game functionalities are implemented.

## **3. Challenges Faced**

- **Session Management:**
  - Ensuring secure session handling for user authentication required careful implementation to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Achieving a balance between aesthetic appeal and responsiveness was challenging, especially without initial design mockups.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implementing comprehensive error messages to guide users effectively required iterative testing and adjustments.

## **4. Solutions Implemented**

- **Security:**
  - Employed PHP's built-in functions for password hashing and verification to enhance security.
  - Utilized `mysqli_real_escape_string` to sanitize user inputs and prevent SQL injection.

- **Design:**
  - Leveraged Bootstrap's grid system and components to create a responsive and accessible design.
  - Customized Bootstrap styles to align with the project's color scheme and aesthetic preferences.

- **Documentation:**
  - Maintained thorough documentation to ensure clarity in the development process and facilitate future enhancements.

## **5. Next Steps**

With the frontend's foundational elements in place, the next phase involves implementing the actual game functionalities. We'll proceed to **Step 4: Backend Development**, where we'll focus on developing the core game logic, integrating the frontend with the backend, and managing game data.

### **Whatâ€™s Next?**

We'll advance to **Step 4: Backend Development**, which includes:

1. **Implementing Game Logic:**
   - Developing the core functionalities for TicTacToe, Connect the Dots, and Hangman.
   - Integrating AI for single-player modes with selectable difficulty levels.

2. **Frontend-Backend Integration:**
   - Using AJAX for asynchronous communication between the frontend and backend.
   - Ensuring seamless data flow for user actions, game states, and leaderboard updates.

3. **Enhancing User Experience:**
   - Implementing visual and textual feedback mechanisms.
   - Ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across all components.
