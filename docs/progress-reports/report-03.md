# Progress Report 2

**Date:** February 20, 2025

## Overview

This report summarizes the progress made during the second development phase of the TicTacToe game within RetroPlayHub. The primary focus was on enhancing game features, optimizing AI performance, conducting thorough testing, and preparing for deployment.

## Achievements

1. **AI Enhancement:**
   - Successfully implemented the Minimax algorithm for the Hard difficulty level, enabling the AI to make optimal moves and provide a challenging experience.
   - Introduced adaptive AI strategies that adjust based on the player's skill level.

2. **Game History and Scoring:**
   - Developed backend functionalities to accurately record each game outcome in the `game_history` table.
   - Implemented score calculation logic in `game_controller.php` to update user scores in the `scores` table based on game results.
   - Created frontend components to display user game history and current scores.

3. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Added animations for cell selections and AI moves to enhance visual feedback.
   - Incorporated sound effects for actions like placing a mark, winning, or drawing to improve user engagement.
   - Optimized the game interface for mobile devices, ensuring seamless gameplay across all screen sizes.

4. **User Authentication Enhancements:**
   - Enhanced security measures by implementing password hashing using `password_hash` with `PASSWORD_BCRYPT`.
   - Added email verification during user registration to ensure account authenticity and security.

5. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Conducted extensive testing across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
   - Identified and resolved bugs related to session management and AJAX request handling.
   - Performed user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

6. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Updated the Developer Guide with comprehensive API documentation and system architecture details.
   - Enhanced the User Guide with detailed game instructions and troubleshooting tips.
   - Completed initial and secondary progress reports to track development milestones.

## Challenges

- **AI Performance Optimization:**
  - Initial implementation of the Minimax algorithm was resource-intensive, causing delays in AI move processing.
  - Optimized the algorithm by implementing alpha-beta pruning to reduce computational overhead and improve response times.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
  - Encountered inconsistencies in how different browsers rendered the game interface.
  - Resolved by refining CSS styles and utilizing vendor-specific prefixes where necessary.

- **User Data Security:**
  - Ensuring secure handling of user data, especially during authentication and data storage.
  - Addressed by implementing best security practices, including prepared statements and secure session management.

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Expansion:**
   - Introduce a multiplayer mode allowing users to play against each other in real-time.
   - Implement leaderboards to showcase top players based on scores and game history.

2. **Enhanced Analytics:**
   - Develop analytics dashboards to provide users with insights into their gameplay patterns and performance trends.

3. **Deployment Preparation:**
   - Prepare the application for deployment by setting up a production-ready environment.
   - Ensure all security measures are in place and conduct final performance optimizations.

4. **Continuous Testing:**
   - Establish automated testing routines to maintain code quality and prevent regressions.
   - Gather ongoing user feedback to inform future enhancements and feature additions.

## Conclusion

The second phase of developing the TicTacToe game within RetroPlayHub has been highly productive, with significant advancements in AI capabilities, user experience, and data management. The project is now nearing completion, with plans to introduce additional features and prepare for a successful deployment. Continued focus on testing and user feedback will ensure the game's quality and appeal to a broad audience.
