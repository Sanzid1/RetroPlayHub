# Progress Report 1

**Date:** January 13, 2025

## Overview

This report outlines the progress made during the initial development phase of the TicTacToe game within the RetroPlayHub project. The focus was on project setup, environment configuration, and implementing core game functionalities.

## Achievements

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Established the directory structure for the TicTacToe component, organizing frontend, backend, and assets effectively.
   - Configured XAMPP environment, ensuring Apache and MySQL services are running correctly.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Created the `retroplyhub_db` database with necessary tables:
     - `users`
     - `game_history`
     - `scores`
   - Implemented secure connection handling in `database.php` using MySQLi.

3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Designed the game interface using HTML and Bootstrap for responsive layout.
   - Styled the TicTacToe board and controls with custom CSS in `tictactoe.css`.
   - Developed the initial JavaScript logic in `tictactoe.js` to handle user interactions and game state updates.

4. **Backend Development:**
   - Implemented `game_controller.php` to manage game logic, including move processing and AI behavior.
   - Established session management to maintain game state across user interactions.
   - Developed basic AI strategies for different difficulty levels.

5. **User Authentication:**
   - Set up user registration and login functionalities to secure game access.
   - Ensured that only authenticated users can play and have their game data recorded.

## Challenges

- **AJAX Communication:**
  - Encountered issues with malformed JSON responses due to unintended PHP outputs.
  - Resolved by removing closing PHP tags and disabling error displays to ensure clean JSON responses.

- **AI Logic Complexity:**
  - Developing the Minimax algorithm for the Hard difficulty level proved challenging.
  - Simplified initial AI strategies and planned iterative enhancements for optimal AI behavior.

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance AI Capabilities:**
   - Refine the Minimax algorithm for the Hard difficulty to ensure unbeatable AI performance.
   - Implement additional AI strategies for more dynamic gameplay.

2. **Improve UI/UX:**
   - Add animations and sound effects to enhance user engagement.
   - Optimize the interface for better responsiveness on mobile devices.

3. **Implement Game History and Scores:**
   - Develop backend functionalities to accurately record and display game history and user scores.
   - Create frontend components to visualize user performance over time.

4. **Conduct Testing:**
   - Perform thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure consistent performance.
   - Gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

The initial phase of developing the TicTacToe game within RetroPlayHub has been successfully completed, laying a solid foundation for further enhancements. With core functionalities in place and key challenges addressed, the project is poised for the next development stages focused on feature expansion and user experience optimization.
